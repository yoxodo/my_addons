# web_one2many_selectable
This module adds the capability of selecting multiple records in one2many to perform
operations. To use it, simply add widget='one2many_selectable' to your one2many field.
You will get the selected ids of the lines and can pass it to your Python function
I have commented the Python function calls from Javascript so that you can fill it up
with your own model name and function name.
